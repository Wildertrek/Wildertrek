## 👋 About Me

I am an **AI Researcher and Applied Engineer** dedicated to bridging the gap between theoretical AI alignment and production reality. Currently, I serve as the **Director of AI at US AI**, where I lead the vision for secure, scalable, and human-aligned artificial intelligence across federal, defense, and commercial sectors.

My work treats AI as an empirical science—combining large-scale observational instruments with rigorous behavioral evaluation.

## 🔬 Research & PhD Focus (ABD)

My doctoral research at the **University of Tennessee** focuses on **Personality-Aware AI** and the development of novel evaluation frameworks for LLM agents.

- **MindBench Studio**: An experimentation hub for evaluating the **trait stability** and cooperative dynamics of AI agents over long-context interactions.
- **Computational Atlas of Personality**: A machine-readable taxonomy of 44 psychometric models (ACM TIST) designed to measure how AI systems represent human values.
- **PRISM Protocol**: A framework for dynamic state representation to enable more **steerable** and **interpretable** agentic systems.

## 🏗️ Featured Projects

### 🧠 **VA CLEVER Pipeline**
- **Role:** Architecture & Implementation Lead.
- **Impact:** Developed the VA’s first production GenAI pipeline, processing **1.5M+ clinical notes daily** at **FedRAMP High**.
- **Innovation:** Utilized the pipeline as an observational instrument to detect **Social Determinants of Mental Health (SDoH)**, directly connecting model capabilities to human wellbeing.

### 🤖 **Public Sector AI Information Assistant**
- An enterprise-grade RAG reference architecture integrating **Azure OpenAI** with large-scale data retrieval.
- Features dynamic prompting, explainability, and citation-traceable responses for high-stakes decision support.

### 🕸️ **Governance & Knowledge Graphs**
- Built knowledge graphs based on **NIST SP 800-53** to visualize compliance relationships and automate AI risk management.

## 🧑‍🏫 Teaching & Pedagogy

I authored and teach **COSC 650: Advanced Applications of LLMs**, a graduate-level course covering:
- **Foundations**: Transformers, embeddings, and historical LM architectures.
- **Applied AI**: RAG pipelines, Agentic Workflows, and Plan-and-Execute flows.
- **Responsible AI**: Constitutional AI, evaluation metrics, and ethical safety boundaries.
- [AA-LLM-Course Repository](https://github.com/Wildertrek/AA-LLM-Course)

## 📈 Current Focus Areas

- **Behavioral Benchmarking**: Expanding **MindBench** to detect "alignment faking" and deceptive compliance in LLM agents.
- **Persona Vectors**: Researching the stability of character traits and "persona vectors" in multi-agent social dynamics.
- **Empirical Evaluation**: Building the "telescopes" (like **Clio**) required to observe and steer the societal impacts of AI.
