## üëã About Me

Welcome to my GitHub! I am an AI Architect and Engineering Lead with expertise in advancing AI and ML initiatives, particularly within the federal sector. My work bridges the gap between academic research and practical applications, focusing on:

- **AI Engineering**: Designing scalable AI systems that meet enterprise and mission-critical needs.  
- **MLOps**: Building robust pipelines to support model lifecycle management and operational excellence.  
- **Data Governance**: Ensuring data quality, security, and compliance across large-scale systems.  
- **AI Capability Development**: Advancing AI maturity modeling and implementing next-generation NLP and LLM solutions.  

Currently, I lead the development of cutting-edge AI capabilities for the Summit Data Platform at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, empowering innovative solutions for real-world challenges.

Here's your updated section with the **üî¨ Microscope** emoji:


## üî¨ Research Interests

- **AI Capability Maturity**: Developing frameworks to assess and enhance AI maturity, focusing on MLOps, CloudOps, and data governance.  
- **Advanced LLM Applications**: Exploring large language models (LLMs) for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), function calling, and responsible AI practices.  
- **Psychology and AI**: Integrating psychological trait models with AI to advance applications in education, healthcare, and personalized learning environments.  

## üîç Projects

### üèóÔ∏è **AI Capability Maturity Model**
- Curates and prioritizes AI use cases for enterprise-wide implementation.  
- Develops AI maturity stages with a focus on enhancing DevOps, DataOps, and AI Ops layers.

### üß† **VA GenAI Pipeline (CLEVER Pipeline)**
- Processes over 1.5 million clinical notes daily to provide actionable insights into social determinants of health.  
- Leverages generative AI to support veteran-focused applications, enabling scalable NLP solutions.

### ü§ñ **VA Public Sector Information Assistant**
- A customizable generative AI template integrating Azure OpenAI with large language models (LLMs).  
- Employs **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to enable "chat with your own data" capabilities without requiring model fine-tuning.  
- Key features include:  
  - **Azure AI Search**: Simplifies data ingestion, transformation, indexing, and multilingual translation for seamless retrieval.  
  - **Dynamic Prompts**: Adapts based on model type for optimal performance and allows personalized interactions through customizable settings.  
  - **Explainability and Citations**: Delivers traceable responses with references for verification.  
- An end-to-end reference solution, complete with documentation and deployable code, to support the creation of domain-specific AI systems.

### üï∏Ô∏è **Knowledge Graphs and Ontologies**
- Builds knowledge graphs based on NIST SP 800-53 to visualize control relationships and analyze compliance structures.  
- Integrates cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) with AI risk management for enhanced oversight.

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Teaching & Courses

I teach **Advanced Applications of Large Language Models (LLMs)**, a graduate course that dives into foundational AI models, prompt engineering, ethical considerations, and hands-on projects. The course covers:
- Foundations of LLMs and transformers
- Prompt engineering and RAG
- Practical applications with LangChain, LlamaIndex, and graph data structures with LangGraph
[AA-LLM-Course](https://github.com/Wildertrek/AA-LLM-Course)

## üìà Current Focus Areas

- **Expanding NLP Pipelines**: Enhancing NLP pipelines on the Summit Data Platform (SDP) with generative AI and LLM support.
- **Implementing the Public Sector Information Assistant**: VA teams are able to interact with their own data.
- **AI in Compliance**: Applying AI to compliance data, including knowledge graphs for NIST 800-53 controls and DASF 2.0.
- **Data Governance for AI**: Developing a comprehensive AI/ML metamodel to support traceability, security, and governance.

## üå± Personal Projects

- **Exploring Personality Models**: Creating a comprehensive character model based on multiple personality theories.
- **Exploring Neo4j Graph Visualizations**: Visualizing personality models and AI maturity models with connected data insights.
