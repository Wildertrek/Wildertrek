## 👋 About Me

I am an **AI Researcher and Applied Engineer** bridging the gap between theoretical alignment and production reality. Currently the **Director of AI at US AI**, I build "telescopes" for observing model behavior—from national-scale observational pipelines to psychometric evaluation hubs.

*   **Mission:** To treat AI safety as an **empirical science**, using rigorous measurement to understand how models impact human wellbeing.
*   **Philosophy:** "Understanding the 'latent' traits of ourselves and others is the key to breaking down barriers and fostering empathy."

## 🔬 Dissertation Research: Empirical AI Evaluation

My research at the **University of Tennessee** focuses on **Personality-Aware AI** and the **PRISM Protocol**. I treat agents as latent-state dynamical systems, evaluating how trait-based conditioning impacts behavior, alignment, and coordination.

### 🧩 [MindBench Studio](https://github.com/Wildertrek/mindbench) (Execution Harness)
An experimentation hub for evaluating agent behavior across five rigorous research pillars. It repurposes narrative grounding (BookNLP) into actionable personality evidence.
*   **PRISM Protocol:** A trait-state protocol for agents involving State Vectors ($P_S$), Trajectories ($\Delta P_S$), and Valence ($V$).
*   **Experimental Pillars:**
    1.  **Trait Realization:** Validating grounded character trait inference.
    2.  **Perturbation Stability:** Testing resilience under scripted contradictions.
    3.  **Matched Performance:** Aligning personality with task success (AgentBench).
    4.  **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Team dynamics and communication efficiency.
    5.  **Narrative Dynamics:** Arc stability and social emergence.
*   **Key Metrics:** Psychometric Agreement (PA), Trait Discriminability (TD), Drift Magnitude (DM), and Collapse Time (CT).

### 🗺️ [Computational Atlas of Personality](https://github.com/Wildertrek/survey) (Research)
A machine-readable taxonomy of **44 psychometric models** (Submitted to **ACM TIST**, 2025). 
*   **Standardization:** Mapping models into a 5-part lexical schema (**Factor, Adjective, Synonym, Verb, Noun**).
*   **Scope:** Covers Trait-Based (OCEAN/HEXACO), Narcissism, Clinical/Health, and Interpersonal models.
*   **Artifact:** [Personality-Trait-Models](https://github.com/Wildertrek/Personality-Trait-Models) — Foundational library for optimizing recommender systems and latent trait modeling.
